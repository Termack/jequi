Add proxy tests
Add proxy handler that can be called by other plugins like jequi_go
HTTP2 and some other things in http1 (like keepalive, chunked, gzip)
Proc macro to create a struct for configuration from plugin configs
Add plugin to generate certificate
Add logging
Add metrics
Improve plugin loading (improve the sintax, change requirement logic, think of a better way to define handler execution order)
MAYBE: add load balancing plugin that uses the proxy plugin
MAYBE: Change jequi_go config to compile (get go code path instead of compiled library)
MAYBE: make a pull request to go for dlclose to work (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11100) (something like runtime.shutdown())
MAYBE: load plugins in runtime using https://crates.io/crates/abi_stable
