Organize code (delete unused structs, fix warnings, add tests, some other things that i probably forgot)
FIX MEMORY LEAK FROM RELOAD (make reload) (pmap `cat jequi.pid` | tail -n 1) (dlclose does not unload library from memory)
Implement granular config for uri and hosts
Implement tests on functionality that was added that is not being tested
Setup more examples:
 - some css and js in static_files
 - small api in go with sqlite
HTTP2
MAYBE: load plugins in runtime using https://crates.io/crates/abi_stable
