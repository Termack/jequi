Read request body
Setup go path in config file
FIX MEMORY LEAK FROM RELOAD (make reload) (pmap `cat jequi.pid` | tail -n 1)
Implement tests on functionality that was added that is not being tested
Api functions:
 - read request body
 - read request headers
 - write response body
Setup more examples:
 - some css and js in static_files
 - small api in go with sqlite
Better handling of config async 
Implement some way of adding extra config without altering /jequi:
 - maybe create a trait like "handler" that implements "run" and "reload" and then add variables to the config with a function in /jequi like "add_variable"
