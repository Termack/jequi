HTTP2 and some other things in http1 (like keepalive, chunked, gzip)
More tests (read body async, http2, some other things)
Reload isn't working correctly when remove or add a new plugin (example: comment static_files_path and uncomment proxy_address)
Add proxy and jequi_go proxy tests
Add Websocket
Add plugin to generate certificate
Add logging
Add metrics
Check better ways to read body async
Add variables that can be changed in the request (and then change proxy plugin to call a function set_peer instead of returning an address)
Proc macro to create a struct for configuration from plugin configs
Improve plugin loading (improve the sintax, change requirement logic, think of a better way to define handler execution order)
MAYBE: add load balancing plugin that uses the proxy plugin
MAYBE: Change jequi_go config to compile (get go code path instead of compiled library)
MAYBE: make a pull request to go for dlclose to work (https://github.com/golang/go/issues/11100) (something like runtime.shutdown())
MAYBE: load plugins in runtime using https://crates.io/crates/abi_stable
